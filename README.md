# Text-to-Video Generation (Concept Prototype)

This project demonstrates the concept of a Text-to-Video (T2V) generation system.  
The interface accepts descriptive text input from the user and represents how video generation could be initiated based on the provided prompt in a real-world application.

---

## 📌 Objective
To showcase the workflow of a text-driven media generation interface:
- Accept user-defined descriptive input
- Validate the quality of input
- Display an output screen based on the prompt

---

## 🔍 Input Guidelines
- Minimum **40 characters** required
- Input must be meaningful and clearly structured

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with actual Text-to-Video AI models  
- GPU-based processing support  
- Real-time media synthesis and output  
- Enhanced user interaction and dynamic content handling  

---

## 👥 Team
**Team VisionForge**

## 📜 Note
This project is designed for demonstration and academic purposes, focusing on conceptual functionality rather than AI-based media generation.
